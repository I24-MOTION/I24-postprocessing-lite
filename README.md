## Benchmarking datasets
The benchmarking datasets released along with this paper are the following:
- `SIM_GT`: TransModeler microsimulation data: 15 min, 2000 ft, 4 lanes
- `SIM_RAW`: Manually perturbed TransModeler microsimulation data
- `SIM_REC`: Reconstructed TransModeler microsimulation data from `SIM_RAW` using the proposed algorithms

The following three datasets are sourced from the I-24 MOTION validation system (I24-3D) [Gloudemans et al., 2023]. Each describes a distinct traffic scenario. The ground truth datasets comprise a total of 877,000 manually-labeled 3D bounding boxes of vehicles, derived from 57 minutes of video data collected across 16-17 cameras. Details see https://github.com/DerekGloudemans/I24-3D-dataset/tree/main. 
- `GT_i`:  Ground truth of a 60-second free-flow traffic scenario
- `RAW_i`: The raw tracking results obtained from the video recordings of GT_i.
- `REC_i`: Reconstructed data from `RAW_i` using the proposed algorithms.
- `GT_ii`:  Ground truth of a 51-second slow traffic in snowy conditions.
- `RAW_ii`: The raw tracking results obtained from the video recordings of GT_ii.
- `REC_ii`: Reconstructed data from `RAW_ii` using the proposed algorithms.
- `GT_iii`:  Ground truth of a 50-second scene of heavily congested traffic with stop-and-go waves.
- `RAW_iii`: The raw tracking results obtained from the video recordings of GT_iii.
- `REC_iii`: Reconstructed data from `RAW_iii` using the proposed algorithms.

## How to run

run `pp_lite()` with the following config setting.


### Configuration settingÂ 
The config setting is located in `parameters.json` in the `config` folder. You may specify the following parameters:

- `description`: give a short description of the run. This information will be saved to database as meta data
- `raw_database`: name of the database where the raw fragments are read. Currently set as "trajectories"
- `reconciled_database`: name of the database where the final results are written to. Currently set as "reconciled"
- `raw_collection`: name of the collection from `raw_database` that houses the raw fragments. If not specified here it should be specified as function input (see below)
- `reconciled_collection`: name of the collection from `reconciled_database` that houses the final trajectories. If not specified here it should be specified as function input (see below),


## Core algorithms
There are three main algorithms in this postprocessing pipeline:
1. Fragment merging (`merge_fragments` in `merge.py`). This algorithm identifies pair-wise fragments that should be merged into one. The merging criteria is that two fragments should have time-overlap, and should be "close" in the time-space domain by some metrics. The merging operation is "associative", meaning that multiple fragments could be merged into one trajectory if any one of the fragments merges to at least another fragment in the set. Finding the merged sets is equivalent to finding connected components in an undirected graph.
2. Fragment stitching (`min_cost_flow_online_alt_path` in `min_cost_flow.py). This algorithm identifies fragments that should be stitched into one. The stitching criteria states that two fragmetns should NOT have time-overlap, and should be kinematically "close". Due to the sequential order and conflicts restriction, finding the stitched sets is equivalent to finding the min-cost-flow in a directed graph. Details of this algorithm is specified in [CITE]
3. Trajectory rectification (`opt2_l1_constr` in `utils_opt.py`). This step simultaneously imputes missing data, identifies and removes outliers and denoises a single trajectory independent of others. It is formulated as a convex program.
